The task is to recreate Space Invaders with the turtle module.

I built the game with obstacles, many invaders and even a boss invader that spawns after 100s ingame time.
The invaders become faster and shoot more often in several steps after some time.
The player has 3 lifes and can shoot every 0.75 seconds once.
While normal invaders drop 25 points after killing, the boss invader drops 200 points but must be hit 4 times to actually be killed.
The user can adjust the color scheme in the beginning of the game.
